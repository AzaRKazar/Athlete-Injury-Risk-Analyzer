## Methodological Evolution and Improvements

Our research methodology underwent significant evolution as we identified and addressed key limitations in our initial approach. This iterative process ultimately strengthened the validity and clinical relevance of our findings.

Initially, our model framework focused on predicting asymmetry categories based on biomechanical measurements from force plates. While this approach yielded extremely high performance metrics (F1 scores approaching 1.0), we identified a critical methodological concern: the target variable was being defined using features that were also included as predictors in the model. This circular relationship created data leakage, where the model was essentially learning the rule used to define the target rather than discovering genuinely predictive patterns in the data.

To address this concern, we implemented two methodological improvements. First, we developed models that excluded features directly used in target definition (MaxForceSymmetry and TorqueSymmetry). This addressed the circular logic issue while still maintaining the same classification task. The strong performance of these refined models (F1 scores of 0.888-0.985), as shown in Table 1 in our Results section, confirmed that our biomechanical measurements contained genuine predictive signal even when controlling for data leakage.

Second, and more fundamentally, we reconceptualized our prediction task to focus on future performance decline rather than current asymmetry state. This approach represented a significant advancement in both methodological rigor and clinical utility. By defining targets based on changes in performance between tests, we created a genuinely predictive framework that could identify athletes at risk for future biomechanical deterioration. While the performance metrics for these models were more modest (F1 scores of 0.410-0.831), they represent a more realistic assessment of predictive capability for the inherently more challenging task of predicting future outcomes.

The ROC curve comparison (Figure 4) clearly illustrates this progression in methodological rigor, showing the differences in predictive performance across our different approaches. This methodological evolution reflects a broader principle in sports science research: the importance of distinguishing between descriptive models (which characterize current states) and predictive models (which forecast future outcomes). Our progression from potentially overfit models with circular logic to more rigorous longitudinal predictive frameworks strengthens the scientific foundation of our work and enhances its potential clinical applications.

## Cross-Sport Analysis Insights

Our cross-sport analysis revealed both commonalities and important differences in biomechanical asymmetry patterns across different athletic populations. The strong performance of our combined model (accuracy=0.903, F1=0.884) indicates that there are indeed generalizable aspects of asymmetry that transcend sport-specific movement patterns. This finding supports the use of force plate assessment as a broadly applicable tool for biomechanical screening across diverse athletic populations.

However, the varying performance of sport-specific models, as visualized in Figure 6, suggests that there are also important sport-specific considerations that cannot be captured by a one-size-fits-all approach. The variability in model performance across sports, with baseball models showing the highest performance (F1=0.933) and track and field models showing lower performance (F1=0.727), further underscores the need for nuanced, sport-specific assessment frameworks.

This pattern aligns with existing literature on sport-specific biomechanical demands. Sports that place asymmetrical demands on athletes due to their inherent movement patterns (e.g., one-sided dominance in baseball) may require different normative standards for symmetry assessment compared to sports with more symmetrical movement patterns (e.g., distance running or swimming).

The relationship between sample size and model performance across sports (with larger samples generally yielding better performance) highlights an important methodological consideration: the need for adequate sport-specific data to develop robust prediction models. This finding has implications for both research design and clinical implementation, suggesting that sports medicine programs should prioritize collecting sufficient sport-specific data before implementing specialized assessment protocols.

## Implications for Clinical Practice

The evolution of our methodological approach from static asymmetry classification to longitudinal performance decline prediction has important implications for clinical practice in sports medicine.

First, our findings regarding data leakage highlight the need for critical evaluation of biomechanical assessment tools. Many existing assessment frameworks rely on thresholds derived from the same metrics being measured, potentially creating circular logic similar to what we identified in our initial approach. Clinicians should be aware of this limitation and prioritize assessment tools that have been validated against independent outcome measures.

Second, the strong performance of our models even after controlling for data leakage, as demonstrated by the feature importance analysis in Figure 5, suggests that force plate assessments have genuine value for identifying biomechanical asymmetry. However, the more modest performance of our longitudinal prediction models indicates that additional factors beyond current biomechanical measures likely influence future performance deterioration. This supports a multifactorial approach to athlete monitoring that combines biomechanical assessment with other relevant factors such as training load, fatigue, and psychological state.

Third, our finding that time between tests significantly predicts symmetry decline, as shown in Figure 14, underscores the importance of regular, consistent monitoring rather than isolated assessments. This suggests that sports medicine programs should implement systematic, longitudinal monitoring protocols rather than relying on one-time screening approaches.

Fourth, the effect size analysis (Figure 3) provides valuable insight into which metrics most strongly differentiate between athletes with high and low levels of asymmetry, giving clinicians a clearer picture of which biomechanical parameters deserve the most attention in assessment protocols.

Finally, the sport-specific differences identified in our cross-sport analysis suggest that normative standards and asymmetry thresholds may need to be calibrated differently across athletic populations. Rather than applying universal cutoffs, clinicians should consider developing sport-specific reference ranges based on the biomechanical demands and typical movement patterns of each sport, as illustrated by the varying patterns of asymmetry across sports in Figure 9.

## Cluster Analysis Insights

The cluster analysis results, visualized in Figures 16 and 17, revealed that athletes naturally group into distinct biomechanical profiles. The identification of two primary clusters with significantly different asymmetry rates suggests a potential new approach to risk stratification. Rather than evaluating each biomechanical parameter in isolation, clinicians might consider holistic profiling that takes into account the full pattern of measurements.

This finding aligns with emerging precision medicine approaches in sports science, where individualized assessment is increasingly preferred over population-based standards. The clear separation of clusters in our PCA visualization (Figure 17) supports the existence of distinct biomechanical phenotypes, potentially reflecting different underlying movement strategies, adaptations, or risk factors.

Future clinical applications might include the development of athlete profile categorization tools that could help identify which athletes belong to higher-risk clusters and therefore warrant more intensive monitoring or intervention.

## Athlete Progress Analysis

The longitudinal tracking of athletes over time, exemplified in Figure 15, provides valuable insight into the natural history of biomechanical symmetry in collegiate athletes. Our finding that approximately 36.2% of athletes showed worsening in at least one symmetry metric between consecutive tests, with 13.3% experiencing significant decline, highlights the dynamic nature of biomechanical health.

These observations contradict the assumption that biomechanical parameters remain relatively stable over time in the absence of intervention. Instead, they suggest that biomechanical health is in constant flux, influenced by training loads, competitive schedules, fatigue, and potentially many other factors.

The improvement rates noted in our analysis (35.0% for force symmetry, 40.0% for max force symmetry) indicate that positive adaptation is possible, but the substantial percentage of athletes showing deterioration emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring. This dynamic perspective should inform how clinicians interpret biomechanical assessments - not as static indicators of inherent capacity, but as snapshots of a constantly evolving system.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Despite the methodological improvements implemented in this study, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, while our performance decline prediction models represent a more rigorous approach than static asymmetry classification, they still do not directly link biomechanical measures to injury outcomes. Future research should focus on collecting comprehensive injury data to validate these models against actual injury incidence.

Second, our analysis focused primarily on bilateral force plate measurements and did not incorporate other potentially relevant biomechanical or physiological variables. Future work should explore multimodal assessment approaches that combine force plate data with other measurement modalities such as motion capture, electromyography, or inertial measurement units.

Third, while our dataset included athletes from multiple sports, the sample sizes for some sports were relatively small, limiting the robustness of sport-specific models. Larger, collaborative datasets that include diverse athletic populations would strengthen future analyses.

Fourth, our longitudinal approach was limited by inconsistent testing intervals across athletes. As shown in Figure 14, the time between tests significantly impacts decline risk, suggesting that more systematic, regular testing protocols would improve the precision of performance decline predictions and enable more sophisticated time-series analyses.

It's also important to emphasize that our study uses biomechanical asymmetry as a proxy for injury risk rather than direct injury outcomes. While asymmetry has been associated with increased injury risk in previous literature, the exact relationship between the biomechanical patterns we identified and actual injury incidence still needs to be validated in prospective studies.

Building on the methodological foundation established in this study, future research should focus on several key directions. Prospective studies linking biomechanical asymmetry to injury outcomes would provide crucial validation of these assessment frameworks. Integration of biomechanical data with other monitoring metrics (e.g., training load, wellness measures) could improve predictive accuracy. Development of sport-specific normative databases would enable more precise risk stratification. Finally, intervention studies testing the effectiveness of targeted asymmetry correction programs would translate these assessment frameworks into actionable clinical protocols.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrated the value of force plate assessment for identifying biomechanical asymmetry in collegiate athletes while highlighting important methodological considerations for developing valid predictive models. By addressing data leakage concerns and implementing a longitudinal prediction framework, we established a more rigorous approach to athlete biomechanical assessment that has both scientific validity and clinical utility.

The feature importance analyses for both current state prediction (Figure 5) and future decline prediction (Figures 12 and 13) provide valuable guidance on which metrics should be prioritized in assessment protocols. The cross-sport analysis revealed both general patterns and sport-specific considerations in biomechanical asymmetry, supporting a nuanced approach to athlete assessment that balances universal principles with sport-specific adaptations.

The strong performance of our models even after controlling for methodological limitations confirms the genuine predictive value of force plate metrics for assessing athlete biomechanical health. The identification of distinct athlete clusters with different asymmetry profiles opens new possibilities for holistic risk stratification approaches.

As sports medicine continues to advance toward more evidence-based, objective assessment methods, this work contributes to the development of rigorous, clinically relevant frameworks for identifying athletes at risk for biomechanical deterioration and potential injury. Future research should build on this foundation to further refine our understanding of the complex relationship between biomechanical asymmetry, performance, and injury risk in diverse athletic populations.
