Teams with higher accuracy scores have more consistent and predictable injury risk patterns.

## Key Insights

1. **Risk Variation**: tennis shows the highest injury risk rate (51.4%), while womens volleyball has the lowest (33.9%).
2. **Statistical Significance**: There is a significant association between team/sport and injury risk (p=0.0001).
3. **Key Differences**: The most significant difference between teams is in rightTorque (p=0.0000), with football showing the highest values and tennis showing the lowest.

## Recommendations

1. **Sport-Specific Protocols**: Develop specialized monitoring and training protocols for high-risk teams.
2. **Cross-Training Opportunities**: Learn from lower-risk teams' practices and implement their techniques across other teams.
3. **Targeted Interventions**: Focus preventive resources on the highest-risk teams and specific risk factors identified.
4. **Key Metrics Monitoring**: Closely track rightTorque, leftTorque, rightMaxForce as these show significant variation between teams.
