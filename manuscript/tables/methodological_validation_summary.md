# Methodological Validation and Data Leakage Assessment

Analysis Date: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This analysis addresses potential methodological concerns in our asymmetry classification models, particularly focusing on the possibility of data leakage that could artificially inflate performance metrics.

## Key Findings

1. **Feature Importance**: MaxForceSymmetry accounts for 36.98% of the model's predictive power, which is reasonable given its biomechanical significance but does warrant careful interpretation.
2. **Model Performance Comparison**:

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Original Model | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| Without Leaked Features | 0.984 | 0.981 | 0.998 |
| Alternative Target | 0.959 | 0.941 | 0.983 |
| Athlete-Based CV | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

## Interpretation

1. **Feature Removal Impact**: Removing MaxForceSymmetry and TorqueSymmetry from the feature set resulted in a 1.9% decrease in F1 score, which is a modest reduction suggesting limited data leakage with other features providing substantial signal.
2. **Alternative Target Definition**: Using an independent target based on ImpulseSymmetry resulted in a 5.9% change in F1 score, suggesting consistent model performance even with different asymmetry definitions.
3. **Athlete-Based Validation**: Ensuring athletes don't appear in both training and testing sets resulted in a 0.0% change in F1 score, suggesting our model generalizes well to new athletes and isn't overly dependent on athlete-specific patterns.

## Recommendations

1. **Robust Methodology**: Our validation tests support the robustness of our modeling approach, with relatively minor performance variations across different methodological checks.
2. **Continued Validation**: Despite these positive findings, we should maintain methodological rigor by:
   - Routinely conducting similar validation tests on new datasets
   - Implementing athlete-based cross-validation as standard practice

These methodological validations provide important context for interpreting our model performance metrics and ensure our asymmetry classification system rests on a sound analytical foundation.
