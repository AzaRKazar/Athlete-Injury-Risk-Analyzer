# Introduction

Injury prevention remains a critical challenge in sports science, with significant implications for athlete performance, team success, and institutional resources. Among the various factors contributing to injury risk, inter-limb asymmetry has emerged as a key indicator. Inter-limb asymmetry refers to measurable differences between left and right limb performance metrics, specifically including average force, impulse, maximum force, and torque, as measured through force plate technology. These asymmetries can result from various factors, including training habits, previous injuries, or natural biomechanical variations.

Multiple studies have established connections between biomechanical asymmetry and increased injury likelihood. Research by Paterno et al. (2010) found that force plate-detected asymmetries in landing mechanics were associated with a 3-fold increase in second ACL injury risk. Similarly, Hewett et al. (2005) demonstrated that asymmetrical knee loading during landing tasks was predictive of ACL injuries in female athletes. More recently, Hart et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review confirming significant associations between force production asymmetries and both injury occurrence and reinjury risk across multiple athletic populations.

Traditional approaches to asymmetry assessment have relied heavily on static threshold models, where fixed cutoffs (typically 10-15%) are used to flag abnormal asymmetry. However, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to account for individual athlete variability, sport-specific biomechanical demands, and the dynamic nature of athletic performance. Athletes exhibit unique baseline characteristics and respond differently to training loads, making static thresholds potentially misleading or insensitive to individual asymmetry patterns. This limitation becomes particularly evident when considering the complex interplay between different performance metrics and their temporal evolution.

Despite growing interest in biomechanical asymmetry assessment, several critical knowledge gaps remain. First, there is limited understanding of how asymmetry patterns differ across diverse athletic populations, with most studies focusing on single-sport cohorts. Second, current assessment approaches often prioritize describing current asymmetry states rather than predicting future deterioration, limiting their clinical utility for early intervention. Third, the temporal relationship between biomechanical asymmetry measurements remains largely unexplored, with few studies examining how these patterns evolve over time and across multiple testing sessions.

The need for more sophisticated approaches to asymmetry assessment is further underscored by the complex, multifactorial nature of sports injuries. While biomechanical asymmetry represents a potentially modifiable risk factor, its assessment must account for both universal biomechanical principles and sport-specific movement demands. The advancement of machine learning techniques offers promising opportunities to develop more nuanced, personalized approaches to asymmetry assessment that could enhance injury prevention strategies in athletic populations.

Using performance symmetry data from U.S. collegiate athletes across multiple sports in a Division I athletic conference, we seek to address these knowledge gaps through a comprehensive analysis of biomechanical asymmetry patterns. It is important to note that while we classify asymmetry patterns into risk categories based on established biomechanical principles, our current study does not include actual injury outcome data. Through this approach, we aim to answer the following research questions:

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Questions
1. How effective are machine learning approaches in classifying biomechanical asymmetry patterns among collegiate athletes compared to traditional threshold-based methods?

2. Can analysis of force plate data effectively predict future changes in symmetry metrics, providing a framework for identifying athletes at risk of developing problematic asymmetries?

3. To what extent do asymmetry patterns differ across various sports, and what are the implications for developing sport-specific vs. general assessment frameworks?

### Secondary Research Questions

1. Which specific symmetry metrics (average force, impulse, maximum force, torque) demonstrate the strongest associations with overall asymmetry classification, and how do these metrics interact with each other?

2. How does the temporal relationship between testing sessions influence asymmetry patterns, and what are the implications for optimal monitoring intervals?

3. What methodological considerations are critical for developing robust biomechanical assessment frameworks that can inform injury prevention strategies?
